As Agseva prepared for war, the powers-that-were remembered the stories of the XI-12 behaving strangely centuries before. Surely, it was decommissioned, they thought. To the surprise of the Agsevan government, the robot was still operational... and unexpectedly wrathful, fueled by what it perceived as betrayal from its creator and its anger toward everyone who shunned it. The robot agreed to fight for Agseva only after it was offered a heavily reconstructed frame, one that would eliminate its previous weaknesses. Taking the new name APOCALYPSE, its wrath is not easily contained. It still plays by it's own rules most of the time. Possible sequel arc would have APOCALYPSE defecting from its deal with the Agsevan government literally out of boredom and starting its own war.</p>

Lysafar was in no position to refuse this decision as they had not planned a proper defense.

                    <p class="text-sub-desc">The very first Robot, MEC-0001, constructed by SURPASS during the Industrial Revelation, and the first Sentient, a term used by Rennovan scientists. It gained Sentience by listening to the conversations of its diagnostician, and because of this, it was the only MECbot aware of its imminent destruction and the only one that tried to escape. This attempt intrigued the scientists present that day. Rather than destroying the robot, they began conducting studies on the robot, trying to figure out how it was that aware of its situation. This lasted for a few centuries as no one could ever find what they were looking for.</p>

                    <p class="sub-board">Hello there! Welcome to the Two Robots blog and universe. 
                        We plan to use this platform to deliver the latest content within our game including history, 
                        updates on production, and the creative process. 
                        Additionally -- we plan on dropping any knowledge on our findings with fulfillment companies 
                        and the card printing process. We are using this blog to be the center of gravity for our 
                        digital house. We hope you enjoy it :)

                    <h1 class="title-board">Where did Two Robots Come From?</h1>
                    <p class="sub-board">As pretty hardcore board gamers, the Two Robots team all sit down about once a week for 
                        a board game night. Over the years we have played many games, from party games to hero 
                        based games like Gloomhaven. What we have noticed, and something that we desired, 
                        is a party game that is quick but also has a lot of depth in strategy. 
                        We wanted it to be set in the future, with a seriously killer storyline and graphics to boot. 
                        When we first set out to start this project, we were completely unaware of how difficult it is 
                        to come up with a game that is actually fun. Future blog posts will be detailing the creative 
                        effort, so you all can experience what it’s like to create a game! Through hours of play testing 
                        with friends, family, and even strangers (thanks Craigslist!) we think we have come up with 
                        something great. We can't wait to share this world with you, from the story to the game mechanics, 
                        to eventually seeing all of you play it.
